 My name is John Jones.  I am originally from Chicago, IL but currently reside in Tennessee just outside of Nashville.  I am a graduate of Tennessee State University with a Bachelors in Business Administration.  I have 20 years experience working in the insurance industry in various roles. My goal currently is to learn software development to broaden my skills and challenge myself professionally.
